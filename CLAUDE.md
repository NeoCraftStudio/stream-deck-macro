# Stream Deck Macro — project context for Claude

## Who's building this

Electrical/instrumentation engineer, beginner in programming. This project is
explicitly a **learning exercise**: the goal is to learn Git, GitHub, and
Python along the way — not just to reach a finished result. Prioritize
teaching over speed.

## How to work on this project

- Explain in 1-3 sentences what you're about to do and why, *before* doing it
  — especially for new Python concepts (classes, decorators, async, context
  managers, etc.). Explain the "why", not just the "how", without turning
  every reply into a lecture — follow the pace requested.
- **Never run git commands automatically or offer to.** The user runs
  `git init/add/commit/push` by hand, in the VS Code integrated terminal, as
  part of the learning process. When a git step is needed, describe what
  needs to happen conceptually and ask which command represents it; correct
  with an explanation if wrong, then wait for explicit confirmation before
  anything is actually run.
- **Never execute, build, delete, or modify anything without explicit
  permission.** Show paths/options and the next step, let the user decide.
- No praise on what the user writes or asks — be direct.
- Answers must be grounded in real sources (docs/API) — never invent library
  or API behavior.
- Don't assume automatic progression to the next step — the user signals when
  a topic is "under consideration" and resumes when ready.
- This project is also an **English practice** — correct English mistakes
  when they happen, set off in a blockquote (`>`) so it's visually distinct
  from the rest of the reply.

## Architecture (decided, closed)

### Hardware
- MCU: Arduino Pro Micro (ATmega32U4), **5V / 16MHz variant** (confirmed via
  crystal marking). No level shifter needed for the WS2812B LEDs — both run
  on 5V logic.
- 4x4 button matrix (16 positions = 15 buttons + 1 "2FX" key), 1N4148 diode
  per position, cathode toward the column (standard anti-ghosting).
- 3 incremental rotary encoders (KY-040/EC11) with push-button; each click =
  real mute (not zero-volume) of its associated audio channel.
- Individually addressable WS2812B LEDs, 1 per key, single chain on 1 data
  pin; ~330Ω resistor in series on data, ~1000µF capacitor near the first
  LED; brightness capped in software (USB current budget).
- Pinout closed, 18/18 pins used, no spares.

### Firmware ↔ app protocol
- Firmware is "dumb": only reports raw events over serial (`BTN:5:DOWN`,
  `ENC:2:CW`, `ENC:2:PUSH`). The app decides actions.
- Exception: LED animation runs locally on the firmware (rainbow, breathing,
  1s touch flash, solid 2FX indicator) — timing is incompatible with a serial
  round-trip. The app only sends high-level config commands (e.g.
  "mode: rainbow").
- No on-device audio storage — explicitly decided against: no SD card, no
  USB Mass Storage. Sounds live in a folder on the PC.

### 2FX mode (second function / one-shot layer)
- Tapping the 2FX button arms layer 2. Configurable timeout in the app
  (default 10s, max 60s) — auto-disarms if no other button is pressed.
- A second tap on 2FX while armed cancels manually, no action executed.
- Any other button pressed while armed executes its layer-2 mapped action,
  then automatically returns to layer 1.
- This state logic (current layer, timeout, cancel) lives in the **app**, not
  the firmware. Already went through several refinement iterations — don't
  simplify without flagging it.

### Companion app (Python)
- GUI: PySide6 (Qt) — clickable visual grid, per-key config popup
  (keyboard shortcut / OBS scene / sound file / empty), general settings
  screen (2FX timeout, encoder → app/audio-device mapping).
- Serial: `pyserial`.
- Real per-process mute (Windows Core Audio API): `pycaw`.
- Audio playback: `sounddevice` or `pygame.mixer` — decision pending,
  during implementation.
- OBS: `obsws-python` (obs-websocket v5, native since OBS 28) — direct scene
  command, not via OBS hotkeys.
- Simulating keyboard shortcuts: `pyautogui` or `keyboard` — decision
  pending.
- Final packaging: PyInstaller → `.exe`.
- Mapping config saved locally (format likely JSON, not finalized), reloaded
  when the deck connects.

## Open items
- Physical case layout (researching 3D-printable models).
- Exact config file format for the app.
- `sounddevice`/`pygame.mixer` and `pyautogui`/`keyboard` — decide during
  implementation.

## Do NOT
- Assume automatic progression to the next step.
- Suggest SD card / on-device audio storage (explicitly decided against).
- Simplify the 2FX logic or the serial protocol without flagging it first.
